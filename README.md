# Mixed-Layer-Depth-Prediction
This repository contains a method to predict the Mixed Layer Depth in Indian coasts. This project is a part of SIH 2020. 
The plots and the study reveals that there is no linear or any simple relationship between the variables.
This can also be evidenced from the correlation coeffiecients among the variables.
Mixed Layer Depth affects the climate and the temperature in the surrounding areas.
After detailed analysis, we introduce lag features in the data, though this is a significant improvement, the score is still not very high.
After analysis in the subject in a more detailed manner, we started analysing the data month wise.
